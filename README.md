# gwynanthomepageproject
A redesign of the Gwynant website for a course that I've been following.  This redesign is not an active site.  

This project was my capstone project for the HTML, CSS & JS section of the CS50Web course.  The site is fully responsive 
and utilizes CSS Grid and Flex tecniques plus implements a responsive animated menu.  The menu combines JS and CSS keyframe
animations to produce a sliding appear/disappear effect.
